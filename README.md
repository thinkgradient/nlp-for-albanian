### Word Embeddings for the Albanian Language
The data folder contains the downloaded corpus in XML format for the Albanian Wiki. The file is in bz2 format so it needs to be decompressed first. We will use the WikiCorpus module from the gensim library in order to extract the contents from the bz2 file.
