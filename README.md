### Project: Natural Language Processing for the Albanian Language
The Albanian language falls under a special branch of the Indo-European languages. It is spoken by roughly 10 million people worldwide with most of its speakers residing in western balkans. There is a need to build NLP capabilities for the Albanian language. This project tackles this exact challenge.

1. Word Stemmer
2. Word Embeddings based on CBOW and Skip-Gram techniques
3. Sentiment Analysis
4. Text Classification
5. Part of speech tagging 
6. Named entity recognition
